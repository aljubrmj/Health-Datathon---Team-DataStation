Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a quantitative measure of disease burden. The National
Institute of Health (NIH) describes DALY as the number of years lost due to illness, disability, or
premature death within a given population. It accounts for years lost due to both mortality and
morbidity. One DALY can be thought of as a unit of measurement that equates to a lost year of
‘healthy’ life. The World Health Organization (WHO) adds that DALY can be used as means to
quantify the gap between current health level and an ideal health condition.
More than 30% of the world DALY rates and over 50% of the global mortality can be
explained by behavioral, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks, which provides
opportunities for guidance and prevention strategies [4]. However, many of these preventions are
already implemented to tackle these critical risks. In addition, modifying many of these
preventable risk factors traditionally mandates that patients visit healthcare centers many times.
Yet, access to healthcare is variable amongst different communities and may not be sufficient to
capture the ill population. Furthermore, controlling modifiable risk factors (e.g. high blood
pressure, smoking, drug use, etc.) requires high levels of personal awareness and cooperation at
the patient end to enable positive change.
